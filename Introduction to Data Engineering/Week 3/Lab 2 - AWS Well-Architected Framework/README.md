## Lab 2: AWS Well-Architected Framework
1. **Introduction to AWS Well-Architected Framework**:
   - AWS provides a framework for evaluating and improving cloud solutions.
   - The framework is based on best practices derived from working with customers 
        across various industries.
   - It includes **six pillars**: operational excellence, security, reliability, 
        performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability.

2. **Six Key Pillars**:
   - **Operational Excellence**: Focuses on effectively developing, running, 
        monitoring, and improving workloads on AWS.
   - **Security**: Ensures systems, data, and assets are protected using 
        cloud-based tools, promoting a culture of security.
   - **Reliability**: Ensures systems perform consistently and recover quickly 
        from failures through fault tolerance and adaptability.
   - **Performance Efficiency**: Builds high-performance architectures using 
        data-driven strategies to meet changing demands.
   - **Cost Optimization**: Focuses on delivering business value at the lowest cost 
        by leveraging AWS tools like Cost Explorer.
   - **Sustainability**: Minimizes environmental impact by improving energy efficiency 
        across your systemâ€™s components.

3. **Using the Framework**:
   - The framework serves as a guide for discussing and evaluating existing solutions 
        rather than offering specific designs.
   - It helps you think through architecture choices for reliability, security, 
        cost-efficiency, and sustainability.

4. **Lenses in the Well-Architected Framework**:
   - AWS provides **domain-specific lenses**, which are extensions of the framework 
        for particular industries or technologies.
   - The **Data Analytics Lens** is especially useful for evaluating data architecture 
        for scalability, performance, security, and cost.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - Explore AWS Well-Architected resources, including the **Data Analytics Lens**, and 
        use the Well-Architected tool to evaluate and improve your cloud architectures.
   - Prepare for a hands-on lab exercise where you'll apply these principles to your 
        own data architecture on AWS.
