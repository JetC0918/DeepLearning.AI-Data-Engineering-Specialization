# Starting the DeepLearning.AI Data Engineering Professional Certificate

### Introduction
I'm about to begin the [**DeepLearning.AI Data Engineering Professional Certificate**](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/data-engineering) course. This program is designed to give me a solid foundation in data engineering and help me build skills to deliver real business value. Here’s what I’m aiming to get out of it:

### Goals and Objectives

- **Understanding Data Engineering**  
  I want to develop a comprehensive **mental model** of data engineering, including the full lifecycle and its underlying principles. I hope to grasp how data moves through various stages and how to manage it effectively.

- **Framework for Projects**  
  I’m looking forward to learning a structured approach for any **data engineering project**. This should help me translate data into actionable business insights.

- **Five Stages of Data Engineering**  
  I expect to build expertise in the key stages of the data engineering lifecycle:
  1. **Generating** data
  2. **Ingesting** data
  3. **Storing** data
  4. **Transforming** data
  5. **Serving** data

- **Data Architecture on AWS**  
  I aim to understand the principles of **good data architecture** and apply them in building systems on **AWS**. This should cover how to design data systems that are secure, performant, reliable, and scalable.

### What to Expect

- **Comprehensive Learning**  
  The program includes a series of four courses that will guide me through the essentials of data engineering. I’ll gain hands-on experience in designing and implementing data architectures using both AWS and open-source tools.

- **Real-World Applications**  
  I’ll get to apply what I learn by working on practical labs and projects, including building data pipelines and systems, troubleshooting connectivity issues, and automating processes with **infrastructure-as-code**.

- **Career Preparation**  
  With data engineers in high demand, this course should help me gain the skills needed to excel in this field, whether for **data science**, **machine learning**, or **analytics**.

### Applied Learning Projects

- **System Design**  
  I’ll be translating stakeholder needs into technical requirements and selecting the appropriate tools for system development.

- **Building Pipelines**  
  I’ll design and implement both batch and streaming pipelines for a product recommendation system on AWS.

- **Assessing Data Systems**  
  I’ll evaluate data systems for security, performance, and scalability and apply best practices to ensure they meet organizational needs.

- **Troubleshooting and Automation**  
  I’ll explore various source systems, troubleshoot connectivity issues, and use automation tools to manage data pipelines.

- **Data Storage and Transformation**  
  I’ll design data lakes and lakehouses and compare processing frameworks like Pandas and Spark for different use cases.

- **Serving Data**  
  Finally, I’ll learn how to serve data to stakeholders effectively for business analytics and machine learning.
